The following resource is a cheatsheet to git commands.<br />
In this class I work with GitHub pages and use git a lot. On this site are a lot of commands that I already use for assignments so I know where I can find information about something new that I learn. I also like that I can choose language on which descriptions to commands will be written so it can be useful for me a lot if i don't understand something on English.<br />

On this page I found beginner-friendly introduction to Bootstrap.<br />
Here is explanation of basic things at the beggining and then here is provided materials and templates that I can use in future assignments. I like that just on one page I can found documentation for different navigation bars, tips, carousels and a lot of different elements!<br />

This is page with source codes for different React components.<br />
I found here multiple elements that include different UI components, animations and other features that can help me when I will start to learn React. With the basic things I can find a way to dispaly elements more beautiful, proper way and learn something new and creative.<br />
Rating: 9/10 (-1 because I consider it as useful now but while I don't started with React I can't be sure that it will be 100% useful)

  Best practices for writing clean code on JS.<br />
  I found this article really useful for me because I didn't work with JS a lot yet bur it is good to start this journey already understanding how to write good code. Here is different aspects that are written in the article: decriptive names of variables, using shorthands, comments and much more. All this can help me to prevent some mistakes.<br />
